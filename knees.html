    <h1>SOUND JF Service: KNEES</h1>

    <p>
      SOUND operates a corp-owned Jump Freight service, named Never Bend The
      Deadline, with ticker KNEES. This JF service generally runs from the
      nearest edge of highsec to our staging points in lowsec or nullsec. We
      generally don't provide service direct to/from trade hubs; for that, use a
      public courier or Red Frog/PushX to move your cargo to the highsec jumpoff
      point first. This is less convenient for you, but more convenient and
      safer for our jump freight pilots.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
      KNEES couriers are always best-effort, and delivery (especially timely
      delivery) is subject to JF pilots feeling it is safe to do so. Only senior
      SOUND members are allowed to become KNEES members, and as such KNEES
      generally runs without collateral on contracts, with the corp itself
      insuring them against loss in any way (theft, JF gank, etc). Collateral is
      allowed, especially for non-SOUND members, but setting high collaterals
      may delay your courier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you arrange otherwise in advance with a specific JF pilot, all
      contracts <b>must</b> be:
    </p>
