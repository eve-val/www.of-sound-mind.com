      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ninja" href="#ninja">Ninja</a>:

      <a name="nullification" href="#nullification">Nullification</a>:
      The property of being immune to <a href="#bubble">bubbles</a>.

      10/50MN for cruiser/battlecruiser, 100/500MN for battleship, and
      10000/50000MN for capitals. To "overprop" is to fit a prop module intended
      for a larger size of ship. Usually only seen with afterburners because of
      the high <a href="#fitting">fitting</a> requirements of microwarp drives.
      Ships with oversized afterburners have very poor agility but go fast
      even when <a href="#scram">scrammed</a>.

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <a name="reinforce" href="#reinforce">Reinforce</a>:
      Refers to attacking some kinds of structure, as well as to the mode those

      fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="roach" href="#roach">Roach</a>:
      A style of PvE characterized by hiding when a threat appears, only to
      return when the threat has moved on. Named after the behavior of
      cockroaches scattering when a light is turned on. Usually connotes
      PvEing in someone else's space. Almost always describes
      <a href="#rat">ratting</a>; mining in someone else's space is instead
      <a href="#ninja">ninja</a> mining.
    </p>
    <p>

      in mid-2019 but the old name is still in common use. Often heard as in

      set) were a meme for many years before being introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="spearfish" href="#spearfish">Spearfish</a>:
      To use multiple command destroyers to <a href="#boosh">boosh</a> some
      but not all of an enemy fleet, separating them. Usually done by warping

      them activate their Micro Jump Field Generators at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="stab" href="#stab">Stab</a>: Warp Core Stabilizer. Each one
      fitted cancels out one <a href="#point">point</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="stop-bubble" href="#stop-bubble">Stop Bubble</a>:

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tick" href="#tick">Tick</a>:
      A single "step" of Eve's simulation. Many effects can only happen at the

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tidi" href="#tidi">Tidi</a>:
      Short for "time dilation", the process by which the Eve servers slow
      down simulating a given system, making each <a href="#tick">tick</a>
      take more real time. This gives the servers time to simulate more action,
      which allows for bigger fights to continue, albeit more slowly. Usually
      given as a percentage between 10% and 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="timer" href="#timer">Timer</a>:
      Damaged citadels, POSes, POCOs, and sovereignty structures enter a <a href="reinforce">
        reinforced mode</a> during which they are invulnerable. A visible 
        timer counts down to the end of reinforcement. When the structure comes
        out of reinforcement, this starts a "timer" during which the structure
        can be damaged further. If ignored, a damaged structure will eventually
        repair itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a name="toast" href="#toast">Toast</a>:
        See <a href="#wand">wand</a>. The action of activating an Entosis Link

      A jumpclone with attribute hardwirings, intended for faster training of
      skills, and not intended to be taken into combat. Sometimes called a
      "learning clone", because skill training used to be referred to as
