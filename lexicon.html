          <a href="#kite">kite</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ninja" href="#ninja">Ninja</a>:

      10/50MN for cruiser/battlecruiser, 100/500MN for battleship, and
      10000/50000MN for capitals. To "overprop" is to fit a prop module intended
      for a larger size of ship. Usually only seen with afterburners because of
      the high <a href="#fitting">fitting</a> requirements of microwarp drives.
      Ships with oversized afterburners have very poor agility but go fast
      even when <a href="#scram">scrammed</a>.

      <ul>

        are countered by warp core stabilizers (<a href="#stab">stabs</a>).</li>
        <li>To activate specifically a warp disruptor on another ship. During combat,
        it may be important to indicate whether you applied a <a href="#scram">scram</a>

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="rat" href="#rat">Rat</a>:
      <ol>
        <li>An NPC pirate</li>

      <a href="#weapons-timer">weapons timer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="reinforce" href="#reinforce">Reinforce</a>:
      Refers to attacking some kinds of structure, as well as to the mode those
      structures enter when attacked. When in reinforced mode, a structure is
      temporarily invulnerable, giving the owners time to form a defensive
      fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="roach" href="#roach">Roach</a>:
      A style of PvE characterized by hiding when a threat appears, only to
      return when the threat has moved on. Named after the behavior of
      cockroaches scattering when a light is turned on. Usually connotes
      PvEing in someone else's space. Almost always describes
      <a href="#rat">ratting</a>; mining in someone else's space is instead
      <a href="#ninja">ninja</a> mining.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="roe" href="#roe">RoE</a>:
      Short for Rules of Engagement. The three common ones are:

        </li>
        <li>

          mix of people from different corps renders blue/red standings
          meaningless.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="roll" href="#roll">Roll</a>:

      <a name="sniping" href="#sniping">Sniping</a>:
      Engaging at long range, usually 100km or more, and relying primarily on

    <p>
      <a name="slaves" href="#slaves">Slaves / "slave set"</a>:
      Refers to the "Amulet" implant set that boost armor HP. These were renamed
      in mid-2019 but the old name is still in common use. Often heard as in

      set) were a meme for many years before being introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="spearfish" href="#spearfish">Spearfish</a>:
      To use multiple command destroyers to <a href="#boosh">boosh</a> some
      but not all of an enemy fleet, separating them. Usually done by warping

      them activate their Micro Jump Field Generators at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="stab" href="#stab">Stab</a>: Warp Core Stabilizer. Each one
      fitted cancels out one <a href="#point">point</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="stop-bubble" href="#stop-bubble">Stop Bubble</a>:

        <li>As in "light tackle", fast and fragile ships that do this.</li>
        <li>As in "heavy tackle", slower and durable ships that do this.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tactical" href="#tactical">Tactical</a>: A bookmark far enough
      from a landmark to be able to warp to the landmark, or to safely warp to

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tick" href="#tick">Tick</a>:
      A single "step" of Eve's simulation. Many effects can only happen at the

      are practically rounded up by this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="tidi" href="#tidi">Tidi</a>:
      Short for "time dilation", the process by which the Eve servers slow
      down simulating a given system, making each <a href="#tick">tick</a>
      take more real time. This gives the servers time to simulate more action,
      which allows for bigger fights to continue, albeit more slowly. Usually
      given as a percentage between 10% and 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="triage" href="#triage">Triage</a>:

      <a name="training-clone" href="#training-clone">Training clone</a>:
      A jumpclone with attribute hardwirings, intended for faster training of
      skills, and not intended to be taken into combat. Sometimes called a
      "learning clone", because skill training used to be referred to as
      "learning" and has its own support skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="travel-inty" href="#travel-inty">Travel inty / travel ceptor</a>:
      A fleet interceptor (hence <a href="#nullified">nullified</a> and immune

      <a href="#instalock">instalockers</a>. Pervasively used in

    </p>
    <p>
