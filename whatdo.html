    <h1>Of Sound Mind: What Do?</h1>
    <p>
      This document outlines what your responsibilities are as a SOUND member,
      how the corp recommends you use your characters, and what ships you are
      supposed to have where.
    </p>

    <h2>Required Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      If you can't do these things, you won't be able to stay in SOUND. The
      list is very short:
      <ul>
        <li>Follow the <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a></li>
        <li>Sign up for <a href="https://discord.gg/grCcAUN4fC">Discord</a></li>
        <li>Configure Teamspeak and use it when needed</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Required Ships/Pods</h2>
    <p>
      There are <em>no</em> required ships or pods; it is entirely allowed to
      be a SOUND member without owning any ships or pods.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Ships/Pods</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>For subcap or armor cap pilots: A Mid-Grade Amulet set with an HG-1005 hardwiring</li>
        <li>For shield cap pilots: A Mid-Grade Nirvana set</li>
        <li>A blops Loki, recon, or battleship of your choice</li>
        <li>Nano / solo roaming ships of your choice</li>
        <li>PvE ships of your choice</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The corp provides options covering all of these niches, so you don't need
      to own any of these, but filling out your hangar / clone bay will open up
      more options. Amulets are very preferred for our lowsec-focused heavy
      armor doctrines, and if we have to reship people out of battleships or
      legions for some reason, we'll prioritize those without amulets since
      you will have 30-40% less HP.
    </p>
    <p>
      The corp also provides entry-level blops, nano, and PvE hulls, but you are
      encouraged to upgrade if you enjoy these activities specifically. That
      said, you will never <em>need</em> to own personal hulls to participate.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Alts</h2>
    <p>
      You are never required to have alt accounts, and it is entirely acceptable
      to play with only one omega account. Playing with only an alpha account
      will not allow you to participate in most fleet content, unfortunately.
      If you do have multiple accounts, the corp recommends this training order
      for your first alt:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>T1 tackle/ewar frig</b>: Racial Frigate to 3 &amp; core
            skills</li>
        <li><b>(Optionally) Mining barge</b>: Mining Barge to 3, drones to
            5</b></li>
        <li><b>(Optionally) PI skills</b>: Gallente Industrial to 3, planet
            skills</li>
        <li><b>Interceptor, bomber, covops for eyes</b>: Racial Frigate to 5,
            interceptor, covert ops, scanning skills to 3</li>
        <li><b>Dictor</b>: Racial Destroyer to 5, interdictor</li>
        <li><b>BR/DST</b>: Racial Industrial to 5, transport ships</li>
        <li><b>Capital core</b>: Advanced Spaceship Command 5, Jump Drive
            Calibration 5, Capital Ships 4</li>
        <li><b>Your cap of choice:</b> Either Amarr/Gallente Carrier or
            Amarr/Caldari Dread, + support and weapon/drone skills as
            appropriate</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      For subsequent alts, it is a good idea to start training recon alts, more
      eyes/scanner alts to use as wormhole seeds or scouts, and/or more alts
      for easily-multiboxed activities like hauling, mining, and industry.
    </p>

    <h2>Recommended Tasks</h2>
    <p>
      You should always prioritize what you enjoy doing in the game over what
      the corp needs done in the short term; our long-term health relies on our
      members enjoying themselves and wanting to keep playing. That said, if you
      get enjoyment from helping the group:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Volunteer for either QM or KNEES to help run our logistical
          backbone</li>
      <li>Scout for either op targets (structures) or ships to shoot</li>
      <li>Scan for wormholes and PvE sites and bookmark them / announce them for
          the corp</li>
      <li>Organize and run fleets, either PvE or PvP</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, all of these take a firm backseat to you enjoying the game. Eve
      is, when played correctly, an exciting, engaging, fascinating game, and
      nothing benefits the corp more than its members being interested and
      active in the game. As such, the most recommended task for you as an
      individual member to do is to <b>find what you enjoy in Eve</b>. Here
      are some suggestions for things you can try with relatively little SP,
      ISK, or time invested:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Solo PvP roam, or lead small gangs on roams</li>
      <li>Go blops hunting</li>
      <li>Run anomalies or combat sites, either in "meta" ships or not</li>
      <li>Run missions, either in Syndicate or elsewhere</li>
      <li>Run the various Epic Arcs, either highsec or nullsec</li>
      <li>Run Abyssal PvE sites</li>
      <li>Go day-tripping into wormholes</li>
      <li>Join Eve's RP community</li>
      <li>Manufacture items or ships yourself, to sell or use</li>
      <li>Dip into highsec trading or marketeering</li>
      <li>Find and ninja-mine gas sites</li>
      <li>Explore for data/relic sites</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It deserves to be said again: <b>the corp is only strong when the members
      enjoy the game</b>. The best thing you can do to help the group is to
      find your own enjoyment in Eve, then share that enjoyment with your corp
      mates - post about it on Slack, write guides, encourage them to join you,
      and so on.
