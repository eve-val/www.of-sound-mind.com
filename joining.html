    <h2>Recruiting Status: Vouch Only</h2>
    <p>We are currently only accepting applications with a vouch from 
      a current or former member in good standing. If you're unsure 
      whether you qualify or have any questions, please join our 
      <a href="https://discord.gg/grCcAUN4fC">Discord</a> and ask for

      to apply, interview, and onboard if you get accepted.
    </p>

      Don't just apply in game without doing the other steps listed here -
      your application will get rejected.

      Before You Apply

    <p>
      Do you fulfill the requirements?
      <ul>
        <li>Have you read and understood <a href="/">the whitepaper</a> and <a
            href="conduct.html">the code of conduct</a>?</li>
        <li>Have you joined our <a href="https://discord.gg/grCcAUN4fC">Discord</a>?</li>
        <li>Do you have TeamSpeak installed?</li>

      Applying
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/MVXGyACcwfadeX5j6">applicant 
      questionnaire</a>. Once you've done this, visit us in our in-game 
      public channel: <b>[Of Sound Mind]</b> (yep, with the brackets 
      included) and ask to talk to a recruiter. Please be patient, 
      especially if you're not USTZ - you may need to wait a while for 
      a recruiter to be available. Your recruiter will collect some basic 
      info and start an applicant file for you, then help you through the 
      next steps.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Either before or after you have filled out the questionnaire, plan to
      attend one of our scheduled fleets. Whether a fleet is open to
      non-members is entirely at the discretion of the FC, but the vast
      majority of our fleets are open to prospective members. Ask in our
      public channel for information about upcoming fleets.

      Interview
    </h2>
    <p>
      After you've applied, your recruiter will work with you to schedule
      an interview. We use Discord for interviews so make sure you follwed the 
      instructions in the Before You Apply section above.
      This interview generally lasts half an hour at most. You'll probably be
      asked about at least these things:
      <ul>
        <li>Your experiences in Eve</li>
        <li>Your corp history</li>
        <li>Your goals in the game</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="invitation" href="#invitation">#</a>
      Invitation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once your interview is complete, your recruiter will discuss your
      application with the other recruitment staff. If everything looks good,
      your recruiter will invite you to join the corp.
    </p>

      then accept your in-game application. Feel free to wait to confirm joining
      in game if you need time to move assets or similar.
