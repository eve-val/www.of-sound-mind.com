    <h1>Of Sound Mind: How To Join</h1>
    <p>
      If you've read <a href="/">the whitepaper</a> and liked it and you're
      interested in joining Of Sound Mind, read on. This document describes how
      to apply, interview, and onboard if you get accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't just apply in game without doing the other steps listed here -
      your application will get rejected.

      Before You Apply
    </h2>
    <p>
      Do you fulfill the requirements?
      <ul>
        <li>Have you read and understood <a href="/">the whitepaper</a>?</li>
        <li>Can you fly a HAC, or do you have a vouch from an existing member?
            (<a href="#why-sp-min">why?</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Do you have TeamSpeak installed?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>

      Applying
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/i9iVyci3bob2CAuC8">applicant 
      questionnaire</a>. Once you've done this, visit us in our in-game 
      public channel: <b>[Of Sound Mind]</b> (yep, with the brackets 
      included) and ask to talk to a recruiter. Please be patient, 
      especially if you're not USTZ - you may need to wait a while for 
      a recruiter to be available. Your recruiter will collect some basic 
      info and start an applicant file for you, then help you through the 
      next steps.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="trial-fleet" href="#trial-fleet">#</a>
      Trial Fleet
      <sup>(<a href="#why-trial-fleet">why?</a>)</sup>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your recruiter will help you find a scheduled trial fleet. We run these
      every week or so, but can also sometimes run them on demand if folks are
      available. Trial fleets will pick you up in
      <a href="https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Placid/Orvolle">Orvolle</a> in
      <b>Orvolle I - Federation Navy Assembly Plant</b>. You will need to have
      Teamspeak installed. The fleet commander will give you access to our
      Teamspeak for the duration of the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not need to bring a ship, but if you want to, you are welcome to
      bring anything cruiser-sized or smaller. If you do not have or want to
      bring a ship, free ships appropriate for all SP levels are available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial fleet generally lasts about <b>90 minutes</b>, and will drop you
      off in Orvolle when it finishes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="interview" href="#interview">#</a>
      Interview
    </h2>
    <p>
      After your trial fleet, your recruiter will work with you to schedule
      an interview, either in writing or over Teamspeak (or maybe both at once).
      This interview generally lasts half an hour at most. You'll probably be
      asked about at least these things:
      <ul>
        <li>Your experiences in Eve</li>
        <li>Your corp history</li>
        <li>Your trial fleet experience</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="invitation" href="#invitation">#</a>
      Invitation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once your trial fleet and interview are complete, your
      recruiter will discuss your application with the other recruitment
      staff. If everything looks good, your recruiter will invite you to join
      the corp.
    </p>

    <h2>

      Joining In Game
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you're invited to join, you can now apply to join <b>Nobody in
      Local</b> in game. A director will give your application a final check,
      then accept your in-game application. Feel free to wait to confirm joining
      in game if you need time to move assets or similar.

      Once you've joined in game, head on over to <a href="onboarding.html">
      onboarding</a> to get set up!

    <h2>
      <a name="questions" href="#questions">#</a>
      Questions You Might Have
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <a name="why-sp-min" href="#why-sp-min">#</a>
      Why do I need to be able to fly a HAC?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Short answer: it's a good baseline that you have enough SP to fly our
      doctrines
    </p>
    <p>
      Long answer: While in the past we were a very new-player-oriented corp,
      the reality of where we live and the type of fights we take make it hard
      to include the newest of new players. If you can fly a HAC, you probably
      will be able to fill at least one role in every doctrine. We bend this
      rule for recruits that are vouched by an existing  member, because we
      assume that the person vouching you will be proactively helping you
      integrate and helping you optimize your skill queue to maximize your
      ability to participate.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <a name="why-trial-fleet" href="#why-trial-fleet">#</a>
      Why do I need to go on a fleet before I even join?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Short answer: because we want to see what you're like on voice comms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long answer: because we want to give you the chance to see how we
      operate a bit, and to get a chance to see how you fly. We are definitely
      <b>not</b> looking for any kind of serious PvP skill here, regardless of
      how many SP you have! What we are looking for is:
      <ul>
        <li>Attitude: no whining, patience if things are slow, etc.</li>
        <li>Comms discipline: knowing when it's important to speak and when
            it's important to be quiet</li>
        <li>Willingness to learn</li>
      </ul>
      The fleet always starts with a brief recap of these three things, so don't
      worry if you've never flown in a fleet before - just show up prepared to
      listen, pay attention, and do your best.
