    <h1>Of Sound Mind: How To Join</h1>
    <p>
      If you've read <a href="/">the whitepaper</a> and liked it and you're
      interested in joining Of Sound Mind, read on. This document describes how
      to apply, interview, and onboard if you get accepted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't just apply in game without doing the other steps listed here -
      your application will get rejected.

        <li>Have you read and understood <a href="/">the whitepaper</a>?</li>
        <li>Do you have <b><u>under</u></b> 15M SP or a vouch from a

        </li>
        <li>Do you have <b>over</b> 1M SP, or if not, have you run the

            (<a href="#why-sp-min">why?</a>)
        </li>
        <li>Do you have TeamSpeak installed?</li>

      Applying
    </h2>
    <p>
      Visit us in our in-game public channel: <b>[Of Sound Mind]</b> (yep, with
      the brackets included) and ask to talk to a recruiter. Please be patient,
      especially if you're not USTZ - you may need to wait a while for a
      recruiter to be available. Your recruiter will collect some basic info
      and start an applicant file for you, then help you through the next steps.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="trial-fleet" href="#trial-fleet">#</a>
      Trial Fleet
      <sup>(<a href="#why-trial-fleet">why?</a>)</sup>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your recruiter will help you find a scheduled trial fleet. We run these
      every week or so, but can also sometimes run them on demand if folks are
      available. Trial fleets will pick you up in
      <a href="https://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Placid/Orvolle">Orvolle</a> in
      <b>Orvolle I - Federation Navy Assembly Plant</b>. You will need to have
      Teamspeak installed. The fleet commander will give you access to our
      Teamspeak for the duration of the fleet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not need to bring a ship, but if you want to, you are welcome to
      bring anything cruiser-sized or smaller. If you do not have or want to
      bring a ship, free ships appropriate for all SP levels are available.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial fleet generally lasts about <b>90 minutes</b>, and will drop you
      off in Orvolle when it finishes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="esi-knife" href="#esi-knife">#</a>
      ESI Knife Audit
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your recruiter will ask you to sign up for
      <a href="https://esiknife.com/">ESI Knife</a>, which is a website that
      allows your recruiter to look at your character's history, assets, and
      so on. This is a standard security precaution for Eve corps and does
      <b><u>not</u></b> grant any access to do anything other than view
      details.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="interview" href="#interview">#</a>
      Interview
    </h2>
    <p>
      After your trial fleet, your recruiter will work with you to schedule
      an interview, either in writing or over Teamspeak (or maybe both at once).
      This interview generally lasts half an hour at most. You'll probably be
      asked about at least these things:
      <ul>
        <li>Your experiences in Eve</li>
        <li>Your corp history</li>
        <li>Your trial fleet experience</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="invitation" href="#invitation">#</a>
      Invitation
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once your trial fleet, ESI Knife audit, and interview are complete, your
      recruiter will discuss your application with the other recruitment
      staff. If everything looks good, your recruiter will invite you to join
      the corp.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="joining" href="#joining">#</a>
      Joining In Game
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you're invited to join, you can now apply to join <b>Nobody in
      Local</b> in game. A director will give your application a final check,
      then accept your in-game application. Feel free to wait to confirm joining
      in game if you need time to move assets or similar.
    </p>

      Onboarding

    <p>
      Once you've joined in game, head on over to <a href="onboarding.html">
      onboarding</a> to get set up!
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="questions" href="#questions">#</a>
      Questions You Might Have
    </h2>
    <h3>
      <a name="why-sp-max" href="#why-sp-max">#</a>
      Why is there an SP maximum?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Short answer: because we want SOUND to be a positive, friendly place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long answer: while we know that players of every SP level have things to
      learn in Eve, our past experience has been that taking a lot of high-SP
      players makes it more difficult for low-SP players to ask questions, and
      can lead to a "bittervet" atmosphere of negativity about the game. That
      isn't fun for anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're over the 15M SP maximum, don't worry - you can still join, but
      there's an extra step. Hop into our public channel or join a couple of
      our regular public fleets, and try to get to know a couple of existing
      members of the corp. We're looking for culture fit here a lot more than
      pilot skill - it's fine if you're bad at the game, as long as you have a
      good attitude about it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <a name="why-sp-min" href="#why-sp-min">#</a>
      Why do I need to run PvE missions to join a PvP corp?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Short answer: because it teaches you a lot of basic game mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long answer: while we definitely welcome players who are brand new to
      Eve, doing a small part of the game's learning curve on your own before
      you join will help make sure that you have a solid foundation and enough
      interest in Eve to stick with it for the long haul. If you need help with
      any of the missions, feel free to ask for help in our in-game public
      channel; there will usually be people there who can offer advice and
      perhaps even assistance with the missions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The career missions also do a good job of introducing you to some of the
      many professions in Eve, which will help guide you towards what you
      might want to learn more about.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <a name="why-trial-fleet" href="#why-trial-fleet">#</a>
      Why do I need to go on a fleet before I even join?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Short answer: because we want to see what you're like on voice comms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long answer: because we want to give you the chance to see how we
      operate a bit, and to get a chance to see how you fly. We are definitely
      <b>not</b> looking for any kind of serious PvP skill here, regardless of
      how many SP you have! What we are looking for is:
      <ul>
        <li>Attitude: no whining, patience if things are slow, etc.</li>
        <li>Comms discipline: knowing when it's important to speak and when
            it's important to be quiet</li>
        <li>Willingness to learn</li>
      </ul>
      The fleet always starts with a brief recap of these three things, so don't
      worry if you've never flown in a fleet before - just show up prepared to
      listen, pay attention, and do your best.
