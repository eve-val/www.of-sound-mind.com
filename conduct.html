    <h1>Of Sound Mind: Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>
      Joining a SOUND fleet or SOUND comms? Go read the
      <a href="#rules">rules</a>!
    </p>
    <h2><a name="applicable" href="#applicable">#</a> Applicability</h2>
    <p>
      This document outlines the behavior expected of SOUND members and guests.
      The "Rules" section applies to <b>everyone</b> (even non-SOUND members)
      in all SOUND-run spaces. If you mess up, that's ok - apologize and move
      on. We don't expect perfection but we do expect you to try.
    </p>
    <p>
      For SOUND members, the Rules section also applies in non-SOUND spaces
      where other SOUND members are present, and the additional "Principles"
      section applies. The Principles aren't rules and aren't enforced, but
      they should still guide your behavior.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="rules" href="#rules">#</a> Rules</h2>
    If one of these is unclear to you, ask a director or #safe for help.
    <p>
      The following are <b>never allowed</b>, regardless of whether you are
      being sincere or ironic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Racism</li>
      <li>Sexism</li>
      <li>Homophobia</li>
      <li>Transphobia</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These specific things are common elsewhere in Eve but not allowed in
      SOUND:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur</li>
      <li>Use of 'rape' as a synonym for defeat/destroy/etc</li>
      <li>Use of 'retard' and similar for any reason</li>
      <li>Use of 'autistic' as a slur</li>
      <li>"REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" as an expression of frustration</li>
      <li>Nationalism, a la "USA #1!"</li>
      <li>Racism, a la "chinese players are all botting"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Some things are simply never allowed, and we will instantly ban you for
      either doing these things or discussing how to do these things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Posting RL information about other players (doxxing)</li>
      <li>Either selling or buying ISK for real currency (RMT)</li>
      <li>Automating the Eve client (botting)</li>
      <li>Out-of-game disruption of another group (DoS or hacking)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Don't try to either lawyer these (follow the letter but not the spirit)
      or edgelord (by posting stuff that is just barely not forbidden). These
      rules are interpreted by humans, not machines, and directors can kick
      anyone for any reason, even if you haven't exactly, technically broken a
      rule.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="principles" href="#principles">#</a> Principles</h2>

    <p>
      These are guidelines for how SOUND members behave.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Listening</b>: This is the most important principle. If a corpmate
      tells you something you're doing is bothering them, listen! Stop the
      behavior right away <b>even if you think you aren't doing anything
      wrong</b>. If you need help resolving a disagreement with a corpmate about
      whether something is acceptable, ask for help in #safe on Slack, or ask
      any director.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Trash talk</b>: we do not generally do this. If you are out solo or
      something, nobody will stop you, but if you're on a fleet, please don't
      trash talk. This can very easily get mean-spirited and disrespectful.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Local spam</b>: we do not spam in Local. A coordinated "gf" after an
      engagement is fine, or a "never bend the knee" after fighting CVA, but
      that's about it. Don't copy-paste stuff in Local, don't paste ASCII art,
      and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Drinking/drugs</b>: while it is (unlike in real life) fine to drink
      and fly or "fly high", you are still expected to abide by this code,
      regardless of how intoxicated you are. Also, please don't bother the
      rest of the fleet with talk about it - we promise it isn't nearly as
      interesting to anyone else as it seems to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Opsec</b>: since we are a relatively small group, we sometimes depend
      on tight security to "punch above our weight" by using surprise. To keep
      good security, don't discuss ongoing or future ops in public spaces.
      If there's another group you think might want to help us, that's great -
      talk to the FC or marshal for the op to see if it's okay to talk to that
      group <b>before</b> you talk to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Noisy topics</b>: there are some topics that we generally don't discuss
      on comms or in the main Slack channels. There's nothing wrong with
      discussing these things - they just tend to inspire either passion or a
      lot of words, so there are special places on Slack set aside for them. If
      someone says "-&gt; #foo", that means they want you to move the discussion
      to #foo instead of where it currently is; please do so.

      <ul>
        <li>Religion (use #religion)</li>
        <li>Sex (no channel, sorry)</li>
        <li>Alcohol & drugs (no channel, sorry)</li>
        <li>Computer nerdery (use #tech)</li>
        <li>Cars (use #cars)</li>
        <li>Guns (use #earthpews)</li>
      </ul>

      A small amount of these things in other channels is fine, but please shunt
      longer discussions to the channels given above or DMs. Also, real-world
      politics discussion is <b>only</b> allowed in #earthpolitics, never in
      #discuss or on Teamspeak. What does and doesn't constitute "real-world
      politics discussion" is entirely up to the directors.
